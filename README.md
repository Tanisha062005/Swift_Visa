Hello everyone,

I have created the GitHub repository for your Swift_visa project tasks.  
Please follow these steps to submit your assignments:

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Create a folder named <your_name_milestone_1> inside the repo.
3. Upload:
   - Raw files
   - Python scripts (preprocessing, chunking, embeddings, etc.)
   - Any output files
   - A README explaining your work
4. Commit and push to your fork.
5. Create a Pull Request back to the main repository with the title:
   "Milestone 1 – <Your Name>"

I will review your submission through the Pull Request.
